# iOS University @ UCSB by CodePath.org
**Course Description**
This course is a semester long project-based exploration into iOS mobile app development focusing on the design and implementation of RESTful API clients. Classes meet on campus twice a week for lab and working sessions. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building three fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course students will apply their skills--working together in small teams--to design and and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.
